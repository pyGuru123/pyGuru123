### Konichiwa ðŸ‘‹

I'm Prajjwal aka pyGuru,

Welcome to my little space on Github. I'm a Student, Developer, and Python Instructor. I like programming and designing. I am interested in extra-terrestrials and trying to understand our universe. I like photography and collecting pictures. Physics is an inevitable part of my life. A simple and down to earth boy who is so keen to learn every day a new thing. That is all about me.
